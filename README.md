bashy-lib
=========

This is a "core library" of sorts for Bash, containing a bunch of stuff that
I (@danfuzz) have found useful when developing new tools in Bash.

It is built to be a base for other libraries, including an initialization file,
`init.sh`, which is meant to be customized for the downstream context.

Stable Releases
===============

This is a list of stable releases of Lactoserv, divided into "current" and
"retired" lists. A stable release is considered current for approximately a
year after it is created, or until an API-compatible release is created that
supersedes it, whichever comes first. Stable releases follow semantic versioning
principles in terms of API compatibility (both of configuration and of use as
a framework); _unstable_ releases do not.

Current stable releases receive bugfixes and security updates, on an as-needed
best-effort basis. Note that, in the absence of a paid support contract, you
should have no particular expectation about when any given stable release series
will get updated.

### Series lifecycle

Each release series starts with a number of unstable releases, with no
guarantees about forward or backward compatibility of such releases within the
series or between series.

Once a series has a stable release, subsequent releases of that series &mdash;
that is, with higher version numbers &mdash; are also intended to be stable.
Should the stability guarantee turn out to be inadvertently violated, the
release in question will be withdrawn.

Stable Releases
===============

This is a list of stable releases of Lactoserv, divided into "current" and
"retired" lists. A stable release is considered current for approximately a
year after it is created, or until an API-compatible release is created that
supersedes it, whichever comes first.

Current stable releases receive bugfixes and security updates, on an as-needed
best-effort basis. Note that, in the absence of a paid support contract, you
should have no particular expectation about when any given stable release series
will get updated.

**Note:** Version numbers for _stable_ releases follow semantic versioning
principles. Unstable releases do not.

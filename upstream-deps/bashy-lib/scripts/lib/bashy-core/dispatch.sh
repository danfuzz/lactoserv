# Calls through to an arbitrary library command. Options:
# * `--units=<names>` -- List simple names (not paths) of the units to search.
#   Without this, all units are searched.
# * `--path` -- Prints the path of the script instead of running it. In the case
#   of a hierarchical (sub)command, this prints the directory (not the `_run`
#   script, if any).
# * `--quiet` -- Does not print error messages.
#
# After the options, the next argument is taken to be a main command. After
# that, any number of subcommands are accepted as long as they are allowed by
# the main command. See the docs for more details on directory structure. TLDR:
# A subcommand is a directory with an optional `_run` script in it along with
# any number of other executable scripts or subcommand directories.
#
# As with running a normal shell command, if the command is not found (including
# if the name is invalid), this returns code `127`.

#   (including subcommands) that was found.
# * `path` output -- Set to indicate the path of the command that was found.

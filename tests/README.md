Integration Tests
=================

This directory is for integration tests. As of this writing, things here are a
bit ad-hoc and not 100% automated.

To run these tests, first build and run the system, and _then_ run the script
`run-all` in this directory. You can also run it as `ubik run-tests
--type=integration`.

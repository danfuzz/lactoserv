/**
 * Base class which implements the classic "visitor" pattern for iterating over
 * JavaScript values and their components, using depth-first traversal.
 *
 * Note that, though this class isn't abstract, it isn't particularly useful
 * without being (effectively) subclassed. In particular, there are a set of
 * methods on this class named `_impl_visit*()`, for each possible category of
 * value. The default implementation of each of these is a pass-through. A
 * useful subclass will override one or more of these to do something else. And
 * in service of implementing subclasses, there are a handful of `_prot_*()`
 * methods, which implement standard common visiting behaviors.
 *
 * Of particular note, JavaScript makes it easy to induce a "layering ambiguity"
 * when working with promises, in that `async` methods naturally return
 * promises, and yet promises are also just objects. This class makes it
 * possible to maintain the distinction about what layer a promise is coming
 * from -- asynchrounous visitor or simply a visitor returning a promise -- but
 * it requires explicit coding on the part of the visitor. Specifically, if a
 * visitor implementation wants to return a promise as the result of a visit, it
 * must use the method `_prot_wrapResult()` on its return value. Such a wrapped
 * value will get treated literally through all the visitor plumbing. Having
 * done so, a promise returned from {@link #visitSync} is indicative of a
 * promise result per se, and likewise the `.value` from the other `visit*()`
 * methods can end up being promise results.

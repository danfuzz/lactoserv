@this/structy
=============

Straightforward "struct-like" base class, to help reduce the boilerplate
required in order to make ergonomic concrete subclasses.

This module includes an additional abstract subclass, which is specifically
intended for creating "configuration" classes (structs which hold configuration
information for other classes).

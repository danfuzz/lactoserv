/**
 * Promise-chained event. Each instance becomes chained (linked, as in a linked
 * list) to the next event which gets emitted by the same source. The chain is
 * available both synchronously and asynchronously. In the synchronous case, it
 * is possible to run into the end of the chain, represented by `null`. In the
 * asynchronous case, the properties and accessors return promises that only
 * become resolved once an event has been emitted by the source.
 *
 * As a bit of "ad-hoc type-safety," this class enforces two restrictions:
 *
 * * Any appended (emitted / linked) payload must be an instance of the same
 *   class as the emitting instance's payload. So, e.g., if you construct a
 *   "kickoff event" whose payload is of class `MySpecialPayload`, then all
 *   linked instances will also necessarily have payloads of class
 *   `MySpecialPayload`.
 * * If subclassed, this (base) class will only construct instances of the
 *   actual subclass when appending (emitting / linking) events.

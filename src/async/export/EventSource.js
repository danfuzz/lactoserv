/**
 * Event source for a chain of {@link LinkedEvent} instances. It is instances of
 * this class which are generally set up to manage and add new events to a
 * chain, that is, this class represents the authority to emit events on a
 * particular chain (as opposed to it being functionality exposed on
 * `LinkedEvent` itself).
 *
 * This class emits direct instances of {@link LinkedEvent} by default, but it
 * can be made to use a subclass by passing a "kickoff" event to the
 * constructor. The kickoff event becomes the base of the "emission chain." As
 * such, it needs to have its `.emitter` available (never previously accessed).
 *
 * An instance of this class always knows its "current" (latest emitted) event,
 * and a client fetching this and then (asynchronously and iteratively) waiting
 * for its {@link LinkedEvent.nextPromise} is the equivalent of adding a
 * listener in the `EventEmitter` model.
 *
 * Instances do not by default keep track of any events emitted other than the
 * most recent, but this is configurable. It is sometimes beneficial for an
 * instance to remember the last N events emitted (for a small fixed-size N),
 * and in _some_ circumstances it may be desirable for an instance to remember
 * _every_ event ever emitted. However, note that in this last case there is a
 * danger of a garbage-accumulation issue, especially for instances which are
 * expected to last indefinitely. (Imagine an instance of this class being
 * actively used in a process which runs for, say, several months.)

   *       `{ path: *(number|string)[], value: *, complete: function }`. In this
   *       case, `path` is the _partial_ path underneath the directive that
   *       (in some form) represents the location of the value being processed.
   *   * `delete` -- The directive resolved to "emptiness." There should be no
   *     result value for the directive, not even a `null` hole if possible. If
   *     there _must_ be some value due to other constraints, then it should be
   *     `null`.
   *   * `resolve` with `{ value: * }` and optional `{ await: true }` -- `value`
   *     should be used to replace the directive in the result, with no further
   *     expansion. With `await`, the value is `await`ed, and the resolved
   *     result becomes the replacement.
   * @returns {*} Result, as per {@link ExpanderWorkspace.process}.
